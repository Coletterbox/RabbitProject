### Day 2, Sprint 2: 60 mins
#### Scrum master: James
#### Sprint review:
* What has been done?
  *  Created the abstract rabbit class with male and female rabbit subclasses. (Seb, Lubnah, James)
  *  Created the controller class, WorldSimulation. (Alonso, Colette)
  *  Created the Display Manager class. (Philip, Tolga)
#### Sprint retrospective:
* What went well?
  * Time boxing went well as each group finished creating their classes in an hour.
  * The planning was good enough that group members knew what to do.
* What did not go as well?
  * Members struggled with Git, so this took up a fair bit of time.
* What could be done differently?
  * A better group understanding of Git before starting the sprint.

#### Sprint review:
* What has been done?
  * The whole group worked together to merge the classes they made in the previous sprint to a branch.
#### Sprint retrospective:
* What went well?
  * The group gained a better understanding of Git as teamwork was used to solve Git issues.
* What did not go as well?
  * This took longer than expected and the allocated time was overrun by 15 minutes.
* What could be done differently?
  * Some group members could have worked on something else as this was probably not a 7 member job.

#### Sprint review:
* What has been done?
  * Testing the Display Manager and logging. (Tolga and Philip)

#### Sprint retrospective:
* What went well?
  * Timeboxing went well.
  * Splitting into small groups allowed more tasks to be completed.
* What did not go as well?
  * Memory exception in the heap means the program lasts for only 33/34 months.
* What could be done differently?
  * Designing the program in a way that less refactoring would need to be done.
