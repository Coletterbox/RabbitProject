## Day 1
### What Went Well?
* We worked well as a team and were able to cleanly split the workload when needed.
* We planned the project (in terms of classes, methods and file structure) very carefully.
* We all had a really fun day.
### What Did Not Go As Well?
* We did not timebox carefully.
### What Could Be Done Differently?
* We could plan our time better.
* We could assign more specific roles.
* We could prioritise user stories.
* We need to more specifically define our DoD.
