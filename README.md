**TODO: Maybe move sprint log to another file, or add contents list (with links) to this file.**

----

**TODO: Add project specs to readme.** 

----

**TODO: Fix inconsistent formatting.**

----

**NOTE: Guys, please stop being afraid to make commits!! You WON'T permanently break anything; that is exactly what version control is supposed to prevent! Pretty much the only thing that would be irreversible would be if you lost your work WITHOUT committing it. Or if we nuked the remote repo, so PHIL, WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. >:(**

**NOTE: Please feel free to use the readme as a sandbox if you need to test Git things! :)**

#### Day 2, Sprint 2: 60 mins 
#### Scrum master: James
#### Sprint review:
* What has been done?
  *  Created the Abstract rabbit class with sub male and female rabbit classes: Seb, Lubnah, James
  *  Created the controller class, WorldSimulation: Alonso, Colette.
  *  Created the Display Manager class: Philip, Tolga.
#### Sprint retrospective:
* What went well?
  * Time boxing went well as each group finish creating their class' in an hour.
  * The planning was good enough that group members knew what to do.
* What did not go as well?
  * Members struggled with git, so this took up a fair bit of time.
* What could be done differently?
  * A better group understanding of git before starting the sprint

#### Sprint review:
* What has been done?
  * The whole group worked together to merge the classes they made in the previous sprint to a branch.
#### Sprint retrospective:
* What went well?
  * The group gained a better understanding of git as teamwork was used to solve git issues. 
* What did not go as well?
  * This took longer than expected and the allocated time was overun by 15 minutes.
* What could be done differently?
  * Some group members could have worked on something else as this was probably not a 7 memeber job.
